# LootBoxAPI
An Overwatch API System.

# When will it be opensource?
We're currently in the middle of packing up our system for an Open-source release, we hope to have it released by 12/07/2016

# About
LootBox is an overwatch based Clan/Community / Developer community that specialize in Team play for Overwatch, unfortunately due to the lack of API systems for Overwatch & a dire need for one, we have taken it upon ourselves to create one from the playoverwatch.com front-end statistics.
